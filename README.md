### Description
This javascript can be used for putting sezzle's widget in websites.

#### Simple
The most simple way to put sezzle's widget is to following steps:
1. Add the class `sezzle-price-element` to the price element.
2. Add a new div with class `sezzle-widget-container`. This is where the sezzle widget will be rendered. So, you might want to put this div just below the price element.
```
<div class="sezzle-widget-container">
</div>
```
3. Add the following code at the end of your page.
```
<script>
  document.sezzleConfig = {
    forcedShow: false,
    alignment: "right",
    merchantID: "",
    theme: "light",
    merchantID: "your-merchant-id",
    widgetType: "product-page",
  };
</script>
<script src="https://widget.sezzle.com/v1/javascript/price-widget/initial"></script>
```

#### Advanced
The system can be used to get price from multiple elements and render on multiple paths relative to the price element. The options to look at are `targetXPath` and `renderToPath`.

`What is a path?`
A path is used to reach an element in the document. A path has the following rules:
1. Each element can be accessed by `classname`, `id` or `tag`.
2. Parent and child elements are separated by `/`.
3. Current path is accessed by `.`.
4. Going up a parent is by `..`.

Example:
If `targetXPath` is `#foo/.bar` - This will look for an element with id `foo` and then an element with class `bar` inside that element's children.
If `renderToPath` is `.` - This will render the widget in the same element as the price element.
If `renderToPath` is `..` - This will render the widget one parent above the price element.
If `renderToPath` is `../..` - This will render the widget two parents above the price element. 
If `renderToPath` is `../../.my-render-element` - This will render the widget two parents above the price element in an element with the class `my-render-element`.

Note that if you want to use a grayscale Sezzle logo put
```
https://d3svog4tlx445w.cloudfront.net/branding/sezzle-logos/png/sezzle-logo-all-black-sm-100w.png
```
into the `imageUrl` to override the default.

**When you need to update the CSS or the widget js records**
We have a system running on redis off of our DB that keeps track of site specific js and css.

The table is widget_server_production.merchant_button_versions - update the records there using the merchant UUID as the key identifier.

Once set, you need to refresh redis for the widget server as such:
```
https://widget.sezzle.com/v1/redis/refresh
```

Done!

## Deploying a new version

1) Update version of js or css (based on new version updating) in the gulpfile.js

1) For js updates:

```bash

npm run deploy-widget

```

For CSS Updates:

```bash

npm run deploy-css

```
